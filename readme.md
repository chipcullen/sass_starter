#SASS Starter

Just my collection of starting SASS files/partials. I'm putting it in GitHub for my own version control purposes.

##Credit
This was all derived from [Sam Richard's][1] [Aurora Drupal Theme's][2] approach to organizing SASS.

The one large difference is the division of concerns: [Aurora][2], out of the box advocates seperating 'layout' from 'design'. Frankly, that was breaking my brain and making me repeat myself a lot.

I redid my SASS structure in a way that is loosely based on Jonathon Snook's [SMACSS][3].

Go nuts. Srsly.
