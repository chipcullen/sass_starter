//The organization of this folder is based on Jonathan Snook's SMACSS - however, he uses the term "modules" - which, in Drupal, have a very different and specific meaning. I'm calling them "components" but there are exactly the same thing: individual pieces of a site


/* @group Components */
//This file should just include @import statements of compontent partials
@import "header";
@import "navigation";
@import "footer";
