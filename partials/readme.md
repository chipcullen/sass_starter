#Partials

This is the partials breakdown. It's loosely based on a [SMACSS][1] approach, though I'm choosing to call the discreet pieces 'components' instead of 'modules'. I work in Drupal a lot, and in Drupal, 'modules' has a very specific, different meaning, and I'm not trying to cause confusion.
